# System Verification & Test Results
**Date:** 2026-01-20
**Time:** 08:07:25+05:30
**Status:** ✅ PASSED

## 1. Executive Summary
A full system diagnostic and validation suite was executed to verify the integrity of the data entry flows and Firebase synchronization.
**Result:** All systems are operational. Data is successfully persisting to the `hopinexpress1` database.

## 2. Issues Detected & Resolved
### Database Configuration Mismatch
- **Issue:** The application scripts (`server.js`, `autoUpdateInventory.js`) were initializing a default Firestore instance (empty) instead of the active `hopinexpress1` database intended for production.
- **Symptom:** Scripts ran successfully but no data appeared in the Firebase Console or `database_report.md`.
- **Fix:** explicitly initialized Firestore with the named database instance `hopinexpress1` and enabled `experimentalForceLongPolling` to resolve connection stability issues.

## 3. Database Collection Verification
**Script Executed:** `scripts/check_database_content.js`

| Collection | Initial Count | Final Count | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **INVENTORY** | 0 | 4 | ✅ Populated |
| **STAFF** | 9 | 9 | ✅ Verified |
| **ATTENDANCE** | 54 | 54 | ✅ Verified |
| **TRANSACTIONS** | 0 | 0 | ➖ Empty (Expected) |

## 4. System Test Suite Log
**Script Executed:** `scripts/runSystemTest.js`
