## 📘 1. User Acquisition & Retention (The Growth Engine)
**Target:** Marketing Managers & Growth Hackers

### Core Strategy: "Hyper-Local Domination"
Instead of national TV ads, we use precise, geo-fenced digital campaigns.

### Tactics:
1.  **The "Golden Mile" Leafleting:**
    - Physical QR-code magnets distributed to every house within 1 mile of a Dark Store.
    - Offer: "First Delivery FREE + Free Milk".
2.  **Gamified Referral:**
    - "Give £10, Get £10".
    - Users unlock "VIP Status" (Free delivery forever) after 5 referrals.
3.  **Contextual Push Notifications (AI-Driven):**
    - *Rainy Day:* "Wet outside? 🌧️ Get hot soup in 10 mins."
    - *Match Day:* "Kick-off in 20 mins. Cold beers ready? 🍺"

## 📕 2. The Shopkeeper / Dark Store Manager (The Hub)
**Target:** Store Managers & Pickers

### Daily Routine:
1.  **06:00 AM - Fresh In-Take:**
    - Receive fresh produce.
    - Use **AI Scanner** to flag items with <2 days shelf life for immediate "Flash Sale".
2.  **The "Pick & Pack" Flow:**
    - App sounds "Klaxon" alert.
    - Picker follows the app's optimized route (Heavy items first -> Frozen last).
    - **Target Pick Time:** < 2 minutes per order.
3.  **Inventory Audits:**
    - End-of-day "Cycle Count" of high-value items (Vapes, Alcohol).

**Target:** Riders & Drivers

### The "Hop-In Rider" Promise:

### Onboarding Checklist:
