# AI Photo Studio Skill

Use this skill to permanently fix "broken image" cards by generating high-quality assets on demand.

## Capabilities
1.  **Generate & Host**: Takes a local file path (generated by the AI), uploads it to Firebase Storage context-aware.
2.  **Auto-Patch**: Updates the Firestore document with the new hosted URL.

## Helper Scripts
Location: `skills/ai-photo-studio/scripts/`

- `upload_generated.js`: Takes a local file path and a Product ID, and performs the upload + patch.
  - usage: `node skills/ai-photo-studio/scripts/upload_generated.js "C:/path/to/image.png" "PRODUCT_ID"`
