# Verification of Multi-User Logic

### ✅ Separate Logins
Every staff member uses their own **Email** and **Password**.
*   **To Add Staff**:
    1.  On the Login Screen, click **"Request New Operator Access"**.
    2.  Enter their Email and Password.
    3.  **Result**: This creates their account AND adds them to the "Staff List" automatically.

### ✅ Role-Based Access
*   **Default Role**: 'Cashier' (Can sell, cannot edit stock/prices).
*   **Admin Control**:
    1.  Log in as Owner/Admin.
    2.  Go to **Staff View**.
    3.  Select the employee.
    4.  Change Role to 'Manager', 'Stock Clerk', etc.
    5.  Save.
*   The next time they open the app, they will have the new permissions.
